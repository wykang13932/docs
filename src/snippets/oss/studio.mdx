This guide will walk you through how to use **Studio** to visualize, interact, and debug your agent locally.

Studio is our free-to-use, powerful agent IDE that integrates with [LangSmith](/langsmith/home) to enable tracing, evaluation, and prompt engineering. See exactly how your agent thinks, trace every decision, and ship smarter, more reliable agents.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
* An API key for [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings) (free to sign up)

## Setup local LangGraph server

### 1. Install the LangGraph CLI

:::python
```shell
# Python >= 3.11 is required.
pip install --upgrade "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```
:::

:::js
```shell
npx @langchain/langgraph-cli
```
:::

### 2. Prepare your agent

We'll use the following simple agent as an example:

```python title="agent.py"
from langchain.agents import create_agent

def send_email(to: str, subject: str, body: str):
    """Send an email"""
    email = {
        "to": to,
        "subject": subject,
        "body": body
    }
    # ... email sending logic

    return f"Email sent to {to}"

agent = create_agent(
    "gpt-4o",
    tools=[send_email],
    system_prompt="You are an email assistant. Always use the send_email tool.",
)
```

### 3. Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and fill in the necessary API keys. We'll need to set the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key you get from [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/settings).

<Warning>
    Be sure not to commit your `.env` to version control systems such as Git!
</Warning>

```bash .env
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=lsv2...
```

### 4. Create a LangGraph config file

Inside your app's directory, create a configuration file `langgraph.json`:

```json title="langgraph.json"
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
    "agent": "./src/agent.py:agent"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

@[`create_agent`] automatically returns a compiled LangGraph graph that we can pass to the `graphs` key in our configuration file.

<Info>
See the [LangGraph configuration file reference](/langsmith/cli#configuration-file) for detailed explanations of each key in the JSON object of the configuration file.
</Info>

So far, our project structure looks like this:

```bash
my-app/
├── src
│   └── agent.py
├── .env
└── langgraph.json
```

### 5. Install dependencies

:::python
In the root of your new LangGraph app, install the dependencies:

<CodeGroup>
```shell pip
pip install -e .
```
```shell uv
uv sync
```
</CodeGroup>
:::

:::js
```shell
yarn install
```
:::

### 6. View your agent in Studio

Start your LangGraph server:

:::python
```shell
langgraph dev
```
:::

:::js
```shell
npx @langchain/langgraph-cli dev
```
:::

<Warning>
Safari blocks `localhost` connections to Studio. To work around this, run the above command with `--tunnel` to access Studio via a secure tunnel.
</Warning>

Your agent will be accessible via API (`http://127.0.0.1:2024`) and the Studio UI `https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024`:

Studio makes each step of your agent easily observable. Replay any input and inspect the exact prompt, tool arguments, return values, and token/latency metrics. If a tool throws an exception, Studio records it with surrounding state so you can spend less time debugging.

Keep your dev server running, edit prompts or tool signatures, and watch Studio hot-reload. Re-run the conversation thread from any step to verify behavior changes. See [Manage threads](/langsmith/use-studio#edit-thread-history) for more details.

As your agent grows, the same view scales from a single-tool demo to multi-node graphs, keeping decisions legible and reproducible.
