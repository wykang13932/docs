This guide explains LangSmith's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), including role types, permissions, and best practices. For a comprehensive reference table of operations and which roles can perform them, see [Workspace Operations Reference](/langsmith/workspace-operations).

## Overview

LangSmith uses a two-tier RBAC system:

- **Workspace-level permissions**: Control access to resources within a specific workspace (projects, datasets, runs, etc.)
- **Organization-level permissions**: Control access to organization-wide settings, billing, member management, and workspace creation

Each user can have:
- One **organization role** that applies across the entire organization
- One **workspace role** per workspace they're a member of

Additionally, organizations can create [custom roles](#custom-roles) with granular permission combinations.

## Role Types

Workspace roles control what users can do with resources inside a workspace:

| Role | Display Name | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `WORKSPACE_ADMIN` | Admin | Full permissions for all resources and ability to manage workspace |
| `WORKSPACE_USER` | User | Full permissions for most resources, cannot manage workspace settings or delete certain resources |
| `WORKSPACE_VIEWER` | Viewer | Read-only access to all workspace resources |

Organization roles control organization-wide capabilities:

| Role | Display Name | Description |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| `ORGANIZATION_ADMIN` | Organization Admin | Full permissions to manage organization configuration, users, billing, and workspaces |
| `ORGANIZATION_USER` | Organization User | Read access to organization information and ability to create personal access tokens |
| `ORGANIZATION_VIEWER` | Organization Viewer | Read-only access to organization information |

## Custom Roles

<Info>Creating custom roles is available for organizations on the Enterprise plan.</Info>

Organization Admins can create custom roles with specific combinations of permissions tailored to their organization's needs.

### Creating Custom Roles

Custom roles are created at the organization level and can be assigned to users in any workspace within that organization.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to Organization Settings > Roles
2. Click "Create Custom Role"
3. Select the permissions to include in the role
4. Assign the custom role to users in specific workspaces

### Custom Role Limitations

- Custom roles can only be created and managed by Organization Admins
- Custom roles are organization-specific (not transferable between organizations)
- Each custom role can have any combination of workspace-level permissions
- Custom roles cannot have organization-level permissions
- Users can have different roles (including custom roles) in different workspaces

## Security Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign users the minimum permissions needed for their role
2. **Regular Audits**: Review user roles and permissions regularly
3. **Workspace Segregation**: Use separate workspaces for development, staging, and production
4. **API Key Management**:
   - Use workspace-level API keys with appropriate scopes
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Never share API keys across environments
5. **SSO Configuration**: Enable SSO for centralized authentication and easier offboarding
6. **Custom Roles**: Create custom roles for specialized use cases rather than over-granting permissions
