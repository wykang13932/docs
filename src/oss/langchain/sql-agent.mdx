## Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to build an agent that can answer questions about a SQL database using LangChain [agents](/oss/langchain/agents).

At a high level, the agent will:

<Steps>
<Step title="Fetch the available tables and schemas from the database" />
<Step title="Decide which tables are relevant to the question" />
<Step title="Fetch the schemas for the relevant tables" />
<Step title="Generate a query based on the question and information from the schemas" />
<Step title="Double-check the query for common mistakes using an LLM" />
<Step title="Execute the query and return the results" />
<Step title="Correct mistakes surfaced by the database engine until the query is successful" />
<Step title="Formulate a response based on the results" />
</Steps>

<Warning>
Building Q&A systems of SQL databases requires executing model-generated SQL queries. There are inherent risks in doing this. Make sure that your database connection permissions are always scoped as narrowly as possible for your agent's needs. This will mitigate, though not eliminate, the risks of building a model-driven system.
</Warning>

### Concepts

We will cover the following concepts:

- [Tools](/oss/langchain/tools) for reading from SQL databases
- LangChain [agents](/oss/langchain/agents)
- [Human-in-the-loop](/oss/langchain/human-in-the-loop) processes


## Setup

### Installation

    :::python
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash pip
    pip install langchain  langgraph  langchain-community
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    :::
    :::js
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash npm
    npm i langchain @langchain/core typeorm sqlite3 zod
    ```
    ```bash yarn
    yarn add langchain @langchain/core typeorm sqlite3 zod
    ```
    ```bash pnpm
    pnpm add langchain @langchain/core typeorm sqlite3 zod
    ```
    </CodeGroup>
    :::

### LangSmith
Set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) to inspect what is happening inside your chain or agent. Then set the following environment variables:

    ```shell
    export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
    export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
    ```

## 1. Select an LLM

:::python
Select a model that supports [tool-calling](/oss/integrations/providers/overview):

The output shown in the examples below used OpenAI.

## 2. Configure the database

You will be creating a [SQLite database](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/) for this tutorial. SQLite is a lightweight database that is easy to set up and use. We will be loading the `chinook` database, which is a sample database that represents a digital media store.

For convenience, we have hosted the database (`Chinook.db`) on a public GCS bucket.

:::python
```python
import requests, pathlib

url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db"
local_path = pathlib.Path("Chinook.db")

if local_path.exists():
    print(f"{local_path} already exists, skipping download.")
else:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        local_path.write_bytes(response.content)
        print(f"File downloaded and saved as {local_path}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")
```
:::
:::js
```typescript
import fs from "node:fs/promises";
import path from "node:path";

const url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db";
const localPath = path.resolve("Chinook.db");

async function resolveDbPath() {
  if (await fs.exists(localPath)) {
    return localPath;
  }
  const resp = await fetch(url);
  if (!resp.ok) throw new Error(`Failed to download DB. Status code: ${resp.status}`);
  const buf = Buffer.from(await resp.arrayBuffer());
  await fs.writeFile(localPath, buf);
  return localPath;
}
```
:::
:::python
We will use a handy SQL database wrapper available in the `langchain_community` package to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results:

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

print(f"Dialect: {db.dialect}")
print(f"Available tables: {db.get_usable_table_names()}")
print(f'Sample output: {db.run("SELECT * FROM Artist LIMIT 5;")}')
```
```
Dialect: sqlite
Available tables: ['Album', 'Artist', 'Customer', 'Employee', 'Genre', 'Invoice', 'InvoiceLine', 'MediaType', 'Playlist', 'PlaylistTrack', 'Track']
Sample output: [(1, 'AC/DC'), (2, 'Accept'), (3, 'Aerosmith'), (4, 'Alanis Morissette'), (5, 'Alice In Chains')]
```
:::

## 3. Add tools for database interactions
:::python
Use the `SQLDatabase` wrapper available in the `langchain_community` package to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results:

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit

toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=model)

tools = toolkit.get_tools()

for tool in tools:
    print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}\n")
```
```
sql_db_query: Input to this tool is a detailed and correct SQL query, output is a result from the database. If the query is not correct, an error message will be returned. If an error is returned, rewrite the query, check the query, and try again. If you encounter an issue with Unknown column 'xxxx' in 'field list', use sql_db_schema to query the correct table fields.

sql_db_schema: Input to this tool is a comma-separated list of tables, output is the schema and sample rows for those tables. Be sure that the tables actually exist by calling sql_db_list_tables first! Example Input: table1, table2, table3

sql_db_list_tables: Input is an empty string, output is a comma-separated list of tables in the database.

sql_db_query_checker: Use this tool to double check if your query is correct before executing it. Always use this tool before executing a query with sql_db_query!
```
:::
:::js

Use the `SqlDatabase` wrapper available in the `langchain/sql_db` to interact with the database. The wrapper provides a simple interface to execute SQL queries and fetch results:
```typescript
import { SqlDatabase } from "@langchain/classic/sql_db";
import { DataSource } from "typeorm";

let db: SqlDatabase | undefined;
async function getDb() {
  if (!db) {
    const dbPath = await resolveDbFile();
    const datasource = new DataSource({ type: "sqlite", database: dbPath });
    db = await SqlDatabase.fromDataSourceParams({ appDataSource: datasource });
  }
  return db;
}

async function getSchema() {
  const db = await getDb();
  return await db.getTableInfo();
}
```
:::

:::python
## 5. Use `create_agent`

Use @[`create_agent`] to build a [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) with minimal code. The agent will interpret the request and generate a SQL command, which the tools will execute. If the command has an error, the error message is returned to the model. The model can then examine the original request and the new error message and generate a new command. This can continue until the LLM generates the command successfully or reaches an end count. This pattern of providing a model with feedback - error messages in this case - is very powerful.

Initialize the agent with a descriptive system prompt to customize its behavior:

```python
system_prompt = """
You are an agent designed to interact with a SQL database.
Given an input question, create a syntactically correct {dialect} query to run,
then look at the results of the query and return the answer. Unless the user
specifies a specific number of examples they wish to obtain, always limit your
query to at most {top_k} results.

You can order the results by a relevant column to return the most interesting
examples in the database. Never query for all the columns from a specific table,
only ask for the relevant columns given the question.

You MUST double check your query before executing it. If you get an error while
executing a query, rewrite the query and try again.

DO NOT make any DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the
database.

To start you should ALWAYS look at the tables in the database to see what you
can query. Do NOT skip this step.

Then you should query the schema of the most relevant tables.
""".format(
    dialect=db.dialect,
    top_k=5,
)
```

Now, create an agent with the model, tools, and prompt:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent


agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
)
```

## 6. Run the agent

Run the agent on a sample query and observe its behavior:

```python
question = "Which genre on average has the longest tracks?"

for step in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": question}]},
    stream_mode="values",
):
    step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
```

```

```

The agent correctly wrote a query, checked the query, and ran it to inform its final response.

<Note>
    You can inspect all aspects of the above run, including steps taken, tools invoked, what prompts were seen by the LLM, and more in the [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/cd2ce887-388a-4bb1-a29d-48208ce50d15/r).
</Note>

### (Optional) Use Studio

[Studio](/langsmith/studio) provides a "client side" loop as well as memory so you can run this as a chat interface and query the database. You can ask questions like "Tell me the scheme of the database" or "Show me the invoices for the 5 top customers". You will see the SQL command that is generated and the resulting output. The details of how to get that started are below.
<Accordion title="Run your agent in Studio">

In addition to the previously mentioned packages, you will need to:

```shell
pip install -U langgraph-cli[inmem]>=0.4.0
```

In directory you will run in, you will need a `langgraph.json` file with the following contents:

```json
{
  "dependencies": ["."],
  "graphs": {
      "agent": "./sql_agent.py:agent",
      "graph": "./sql_agent_langgraph.py:graph"
  },
  "env": ".env"
}
```

Create a file `sql_agent.py` and insert this:

```python
#sql_agent.py for studio
import pathlib

from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import SQLDatabaseToolkit
from langchain_community.utilities import SQLDatabase
import requests


# Initialize an LLM
model = init_chat_model("gpt-4.1")

# Get the database, store it locally
url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/benchmarks-artifacts/chinook/Chinook.db"
local_path = pathlib.Path("Chinook.db")

if local_path.exists():
    print(f"{local_path} already exists, skipping download.")
else:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        local_path.write_bytes(response.content)
        print(f"File downloaded and saved as {local_path}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to download the file. Status code: {response.status_code}")

db = SQLDatabase.from_uri("sqlite:///Chinook.db")

# Create the tools
toolkit = SQLDatabaseToolkit(db=db, llm=model)

tools = toolkit.get_tools()

for tool in tools:
    print(f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}\n")

# Use create_agent
system_prompt = """

)
```
</Accordion>

:::

## 6. Implement human-in-the-loop review

It can be prudent to check the agent's SQL queries before they are executed for any unintended actions or inefficiencies.

LangChain agents feature support for built-in [human-in-the-loop middleware](/oss/langchain/human-in-the-loop) to add oversight to agent tool calls. Let's configure the agent to pause for human review on calling the `sql_db_query` tool:

```python
from langchain.agents import create_agent
from langchain.agents.middleware import HumanInTheLoopMiddleware # [!code highlight]
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver # [!code highlight]


agent = create_agent(
    model,
    tools,
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    middleware=[ # [!code highlight]
        HumanInTheLoopMiddleware( # [!code highlight]
            interrupt_on={"sql_db_query": True}, # [!code highlight]
            description_prefix="Tool execution pending approval", # [!code highlight]
        ), # [!code highlight]
    ], # [!code highlight]
    checkpointer=InMemorySaver(), # [!code highlight]
)
```
<Note>
We've added a [checkpointer](/oss/langchain/short-term-memory) to our agent to allow execution to be paused and resumed. See the [human-in-the-loop guide](/oss/langchain/human-in-the-loop) for detalis on this as well as available middleware configurations.
</Note>

On running the agent, it will now pause for review before executing the `sql_db_query` tool:
```python
question = "Which genre on average has the longest tracks?"
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}} # [!code highlight]

for step in agent.stream(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": question}]},
    config, # [!code highlight]
    stream_mode="values",
):
    if "messages" in step:
        step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
    elif "__interrupt__" in step: # [!code highlight]
        print("INTERRUPTED:") # [!code highlight]
        interrupt = step["__interrupt__"][0] # [!code highlight]
        for request in interrupt.value["action_requests"]: # [!code highlight]
            print(request["description"]) # [!code highlight]
    else:
        pass
```
```
...

INTERRUPTED:
Tool execution pending approval

Tool: sql_db_query
Args: {'query': 'SELECT g.Name AS Genre, AVG(t.Milliseconds) AS AvgTrackLength FROM Track t JOIN Genre g ON t.GenreId = g.GenreId GROUP BY g.Name ORDER BY AvgTrackLength DESC LIMIT 1;'}
```
We can resume execution, in this case accepting the query, using [Command](/oss/langgraph/use-graph-api#combine-control-flow-and-state-updates-with-command):
```python
from langgraph.types import Command # [!code highlight]

for step in agent.stream(
    Command(resume={"decisions": [{"type": "approve"}]}), # [!code highlight]
    config,
    stream_mode="values",
):
    if "messages" in step:
        step["messages"][-1].pretty_print()
    elif "__interrupt__" in step:
        print("INTERRUPTED:")
        interrupt = step["__interrupt__"][0]
        for request in interrupt.value["action_requests"]:
            print(request["description"])
    else:
        pass
```
```

```

Refer to the [human-in-the-loop guide](/oss/langchain/human-in-the-loop) for details.

:::js
## 4. Execute SQL queries

Before running the command, do a check to check the LLM generated command in ` _safe_sql`:

```typescript

const DENY_RE = /\b(INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|ALTER|DROP|CREATE|REPLACE|TRUNCATE)\b/i;
const HAS_LIMIT_TAIL_RE = /\blimit\b\s+\d+(\s*,\s*\d+)?\s*;?\s*$/i;

function sanitizeSqlQuery(q) {
  let query = String(q ?? "").trim();

  // block multiple statements (allow one optional trailing ;)
  const semis = [...query].filter((c) => c === ";").length;
  if (semis > 1 || (query.endsWith(";") && query.slice(0, -1).includes(";"))) {
    throw new Error("multiple statements are not allowed.")
  }
  query = query.replace(/;+\s*$/g, "").trim();

  // read-only gate
  if (!query.toLowerCase().startsWith("select")) {
    throw new Error("Only SELECT statements are allowed")
  }
  if (DENY_RE.test(query)) {
    throw new Error("DML/DDL detected. Only read-only queries are permitted.")
  }

  // append LIMIT only if not already present
  if (!HAS_LIMIT_TAIL_RE.test(query)) {
    query += " LIMIT 5";
  }
  return query;
}

```

Then, use `run` from `SQLDatabase` to execute commands with an `execute_sql` tool:

```typescript
import { tool } from "langchain"
import * as z from "zod";

const executeSql = tool(
  async ({ query }) => {
    const q = sanitizeSqlQuery(query);
    try {
      const result = await db.run(q);
      return typeof result === "string" ? result : JSON.stringify(result, null, 2);
    } catch (e) {
      throw new Error(e?.message ?? String(e))
    }
  },
  {
    name: "execute_sql",
    description: "Execute a READ-ONLY SQLite SELECT query and return results.",
    schema: z.object({
      query: z.string().describe("SQLite SELECT query to execute (read-only)."),
    }),
  }
);

```

## 5. Use `createAgent`

Use `createAgent` to build a [ReAct agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.03629) with minimal code. The agent will interpret the request and generate a SQL command. The tools will check the command for safety and then try to execute the command. If the command has an error, the error message is returned to the model. The model can then examine the original request and the new error message and generate a new command. This can continue until the LLM generates the command successfully or reaches an end count. This pattern of providing a model with feedback - error messages in this case - is very powerful.

Initialize the agent with a descriptive system prompt to customize its behavior:

```typescript
import { SystemMessage } from "langchain";

const getSystemPrompt = async () => new SystemMessage(`You are a careful SQLite analyst.

Authoritative schema (do not invent columns/tables):
${await getSchema()}

Rules:
- Think step-by-step.
- When you need data, call the tool \`execute_sql\` with ONE SELECT query.
- Read-only only; no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER/DROP/CREATE/REPLACE/TRUNCATE.
- Limit to 5 rows unless user explicitly asks otherwise.
- If the tool returns 'Error:', revise the SQL and try again.
- Limit the number of attempts to 5.
- If you are not successful after 5 attempts, return a note to the user.
- Prefer explicit column lists; avoid SELECT *.
`);
```

Now, create an agent with the model, tools, and prompt:

```typescript
import { createAgent } from "langchain";

const agent = createAgent({
  model: "openai:gpt-5",
  tools: [executeSql],
  systemPrompt: getSystemPrompt,
});

```

## 6. Run the agent

Run the agent on a sample query and observe its behavior:

```typescript
const question = "Which genre, on average, has the longest tracks?";
const stream = await agent.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: question }] },
  { streamMode: "values" }
);
for await (const step of stream) {
  const message = step.messages.at(-1);
  console.log(`${message.role}: ${JSON.stringify(message.content, null, 2)}`);
}
```

```
human: Which genre, on average, has the longest tracks?
ai:
tool: [{"Genre":"Sci Fi & Fantasy","AvgMilliseconds":2911783.0384615385}]
ai: Sci Fi & Fantasy — average track length ≈ 48.5 minutes (about 2,911,783 ms).
```

The agent correctly wrote a query, checked the query, and ran it to inform its final response.

<Note>
    You can inspect all aspects of the above run, including steps taken, tools invoked, what prompts were seen by the LLM, and more in the [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/653d218b-af67-4854-95ca-6abecb9b2520/r).

Rules:
- Think step-by-step.
- When you need data, call the tool \`execute_sql\` with ONE SELECT query.
- Read-only only; no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/ALTER/DROP/CREATE/REPLACE/TRUNCATE.
- Limit to 5 rows unless user explicitly asks otherwise.
- If the tool returns 'Error:', revise the SQL and try again.
- Limit the number of attempts to 5.
- If you are not successful after 5 attempts, return a note to the user.
- Prefer explicit column lists; avoid SELECT *.
