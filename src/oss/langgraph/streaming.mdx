title: Streaming
---



LangGraph implements a streaming system to surface real-time updates. Streaming is crucial for enhancing the responsiveness of applications built on LLMs. By displaying output progressively, even before a complete response is ready, streaming significantly improves user experience (UX), particularly when dealing with the latency of LLMs.

What's possible with LangGraph streaming:

* <Icon icon="share-nodes" size={16} /> [**Stream graph state**](#stream-graph-state) — get state updates / values with `updates` and `values` modes.
* <Icon icon="square-poll-horizontal" size={16} /> [**Stream subgraph outputs**](#stream-subgraph-outputs) — include outputs from both the parent graph and any nested subgraphs.
* <Icon icon="square-binary" size={16} /> [**Stream LLM tokens**](#messages) — capture token streams from anywhere: inside nodes, subgraphs, or tools.
* <Icon icon="table" size={16} /> [**Stream custom data**](#stream-custom-data) — send custom updates or progress signals directly from tool functions.
* <Icon icon="layer-plus" size={16} /> [**Use multiple streaming modes**](#stream-multiple-modes) — choose from `values` (full state), `updates` (state deltas), `messages` (LLM tokens + metadata), `custom` (arbitrary user data), or `debug` (detailed traces).

## Supported stream modes

:::python
Pass one or more of the following stream modes as a list to the @[`stream`][CompiledStateGraph.stream] or @[`astream`][CompiledStateGraph.astream] methods:
:::

:::js
Pass one or more of the following stream modes as a list to the @[`stream`][CompiledStateGraph.stream] method:
:::

| Mode       | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `values`   | Streams the full value of the state after each step of the graph.                                                                                                                   |
| `updates`  | Streams the updates to the state after each step of the graph. If multiple updates are made in the same step (e.g., multiple nodes are run), those updates are streamed separately. |
| `custom`   | Streams custom data from inside your graph nodes.                                                                                                                                   |
| `messages` | Streams 2-tuples (LLM token, metadata) from any graph nodes where an LLM is invoked.                                                                                                |
| `debug`    | Streams as much information as possible throughout the execution of the graph.                                                                                                      |

## Basic usage example

:::python
LangGraph graphs expose the @[`stream`][Pregel.stream] (sync) and @[`astream`][Pregel.astream] (async) methods to yield streamed outputs as iterators.

```python
for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode="updates"):
    print(chunk)
```

:::

:::js
LangGraph graphs expose the @[`stream`][Pregel.stream] method to yield streamed outputs as iterators.

```typescript
for await (const chunk of await graph.stream(inputs, {
  streamMode: "updates",
})) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

  def refine_topic(state: State):
      return {"topic": state["topic"] + " and cats"}

  def generate_joke(state: State):
      return {"joke": f"This is a joke about {state['topic']}"}

</Accordion>

## Stream multiple modes

:::python
You can pass a list as the `stream_mode` parameter to stream multiple modes at once.

The streamed outputs will be tuples of `(mode, chunk)` where `mode` is the name of the stream mode and `chunk` is the data streamed by that mode.

```python
for mode, chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode=["updates", "custom"]):
    print(chunk)
```
:::

:::js
You can pass an array as the `streamMode` parameter to stream multiple modes at once.

The streamed outputs will be tuples of `[mode, chunk]` where `mode` is the name of the stream mode and `chunk` is the data streamed by that mode.

```typescript
for await (const [mode, chunk] of await graph.stream(inputs, {
  streamMode: ["updates", "custom"],
})) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```
:::

## Stream graph state

Use the stream modes `updates` and `values` to stream the state of the graph as it executes.

* `updates` streams the **updates** to the state after each step of the graph.
* `values` streams the **full value** of the state after each step of the graph.

:::python
```python
from typing import TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END


class State(TypedDict):
  topic: str
  joke: str


def refine_topic(state: State):
    return {"topic": state["topic"] + " and cats"}


def generate_joke(state: State):
    return {"joke": f"This is a joke about {state['topic']}"}

graph = (
  StateGraph(State)
  .add_node(refine_topic)
  .add_node(generate_joke)
  .add_edge(START, "refine_topic")
  .add_edge("refine_topic", "generate_joke")
  .add_edge("generate_joke", END)
  .compile()
)
```
:::

import { StateGraph, START, END } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import * as z from "zod";

const State = z.object({
  topic: z.string(),
  joke: z.string(),

const graph = new StateGraph(State)
  .addNode("refineTopic", (state) => {
    return { topic: state.topic + " and cats" };
  })
  .addNode("generateJoke", (state) => {
    return { joke: `This is a joke about ${state.topic}` };

## Stream subgraph outputs

:::python
To include outputs from [subgraphs](/oss/langgraph/use-subgraphs) in the streamed outputs, you can set `subgraphs=True` in the `.stream()` method of the parent graph. This will stream outputs from both the parent graph and any subgraphs.

The outputs will be streamed as tuples `(namespace, data)`, where `namespace` is a tuple with the path to the node where a subgraph is invoked, e.g. `("parent_node:<task_id>", "child_node:<task_id>")`.

```python
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"foo": "foo"},
    # Set subgraphs=True to stream outputs from subgraphs
    subgraphs=True,  # [!code highlight]
    stream_mode="updates",
):
    print(chunk)
```

### Debugging

Use the `debug` streaming mode to stream as much information as possible throughout the execution of the graph. The streamed outputs include the name of the node as well as the full state.

:::python
```python
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "ice cream"},
    stream_mode="debug",  # [!code highlight]
):
    print(chunk)
```
:::

  { topic: "ice cream" },
  { streamMode: "debug" }
)) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```
:::

<a id="messages"></a>
## LLM tokens

Use the `messages` streaming mode to stream Large Language Model (LLM) outputs **token by token** from any part of your graph, including nodes, tools, subgraphs, or tasks.

:::python
The streamed output from [`messages` mode](#supported-stream-modes) is a tuple `(message_chunk, metadata)` where:

* `message_chunk`: the token or message segment from the LLM.
* `metadata`: a dictionary containing details about the graph node and LLM invocation.

> If your LLM is not available as a LangChain integration, you can stream its outputs using `custom` mode instead. See [use with any LLM](#use-with-any-llm) for details.

<Warning>
**Manual config required for async in Python < 3.11**
When using Python < 3.11 with async code, you must explicitly pass @[`RunnableConfig`] to `ainvoke()` to enable proper streaming. See [Async with Python < 3.11](#async) for details or upgrade to Python 3.11+.
</Warning>

#### Filter by node

To stream tokens only from specific nodes, use `stream_mode="messages"` and filter the outputs by the `langgraph_node` field in the streamed metadata:

:::python
```python
# The "messages" stream mode returns a tuple of (message_chunk, metadata)
# where message_chunk is the token streamed by the LLM and metadata is a dictionary
# with information about the graph node where the LLM was called and other information
for msg, metadata in graph.stream(
    inputs,
    stream_mode="messages",  # [!code highlight]
):
    # Filter the streamed tokens by the langgraph_node field in the metadata
    # to only include the tokens from the specified node
    if msg.content and metadata["langgraph_node"] == "some_node_name":
        ...
```
:::

:::js
```typescript
// The "messages" stream mode returns a tuple of [messageChunk, metadata]
// where messageChunk is the token streamed by the LLM and metadata is a dictionary
// with information about the graph node where the LLM was called and other information
for await (const [msg, metadata] of await graph.stream(
  inputs,
  { streamMode: "messages" }
)) {
  // Filter the streamed tokens by the langgraph_node field in the metadata
  // to only include the tokens from the specified node
  if (msg.content && metadata.langgraph_node === "some_node_name") {
    // ...

## Stream custom data

:::python
To send **custom user-defined data** from inside a LangGraph node or tool, follow these steps:

1. Use @[`get_stream_writer`] to access the stream writer and emit custom data.
2. Set `stream_mode="custom"` when calling `.stream()` or `.astream()` to get the custom data in the stream. You can combine multiple modes (e.g., `["updates", "custom"]`), but at least one must be `"custom"`.

<Warning>
**No @[`get_stream_writer`] in async for Python < 3.11**
In async code running on Python < 3.11, @[`get_stream_writer`] will not work.
Instead, add a `writer` parameter to your node or tool and pass it manually.
See [Async with Python < 3.11](#async) for usage examples.

## Use with any LLM

:::python
You can use `stream_mode="custom"` to stream data from **any LLM API** — even if that API does **not** implement the LangChain chat model interface.

This lets you integrate raw LLM clients or external services that provide their own streaming interfaces, making LangGraph highly flexible for custom setups.

```python
from langgraph.config import get_stream_writer

def call_arbitrary_model(state):
    """Example node that calls an arbitrary model and streams the output"""
    # Get the stream writer to send custom data
    writer = get_stream_writer()  # [!code highlight]
    # Assume you have a streaming client that yields chunks
    # Generate LLM tokens using your custom streaming client
    for chunk in your_custom_streaming_client(state["topic"]):
        # Use the writer to send custom data to the stream
        writer({"custom_llm_chunk": chunk})  # [!code highlight]
    return {"result": "completed"}

graph = (
    StateGraph(State)
    .add_node(call_arbitrary_model)
    # Add other nodes and edges as needed
    .compile()
)
# Set stream_mode="custom" to receive the custom data in the stream
for chunk in graph.stream(
    {"topic": "cats"},

    # The chunk will contain the custom data streamed from the llm

In Python versions < 3.11, [asyncio tasks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#asyncio.create_task) do not support the `context` parameter.
This limits LangGraph ability to automatically propagate context, and affects LangGraph's streaming mechanisms in two key ways:

1. You **must** explicitly pass [`RunnableConfig`](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/runnables/#runnableconfig) into async LLM calls (e.g., `ainvoke()`), as callbacks are not automatically propagated.
2. You **cannot** use @[`get_stream_writer`] in async nodes or tools — you must pass a `writer` argument directly.

  ```python
  from typing import TypedDict
  from langgraph.graph import START, StateGraph
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

  model = init_chat_model(model="gpt-4o-mini")

  class State(TypedDict):
      topic: str
      joke: str

  # Accept config as an argument in the async node function
  async def call_model(state, config):
      topic = state["topic"]
      print("Generating joke...")
      # Pass config to model.ainvoke() to ensure proper context propagation
      joke_response = await model.ainvoke(  # [!code highlight]
          [{"role": "user", "content": f"Write a joke about {topic}"}],
          config,
      )
      return {"joke": joke_response.content}

  graph = (
      StateGraph(State)
      .add_node(call_model)
      .add_edge(START, "call_model")
      .compile()
  )

  # Set stream_mode="messages" to stream LLM tokens
  async for chunk, metadata in graph.astream(
      {"topic": "ice cream"},
      stream_mode="messages",  # [!code highlight]
  ):
      if chunk.content:
          print(chunk.content, end="|", flush=True)
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Extended example: async custom streaming with stream writer">
  ```python
  from typing import TypedDict
  from langgraph.types import StreamWriter

  class State(TypedDict):
        topic: str
        joke: str

  # Add writer as an argument in the function signature of the async node or tool
  # LangGraph will automatically pass the stream writer to the function
  async def generate_joke(state: State, writer: StreamWriter):  # [!code highlight]
        writer({"custom_key": "Streaming custom data while generating a joke"})
        return {"joke": f"This is a joke about {state['topic']}"}

  graph = (
        StateGraph(State)
        .add_node(generate_joke)
        .add_edge(START, "generate_joke")
        .compile()
  )

  # Set stream_mode="custom" to receive the custom data in the stream  # [!code highlight]
  async for chunk in graph.astream(
        {"topic": "ice cream"},
        stream_mode="custom",
  ):
        print(chunk)
  ```
