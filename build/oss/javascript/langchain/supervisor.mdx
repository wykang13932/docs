## Overview

The **supervisor pattern** is a [multi-agent](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent) architecture where a central supervisor agent coordinates specialized worker agents. This approach excels when tasks require different types of expertise. Rather than building one agent that manages tool selection across domains, you create focused specialists coordinated by a supervisor who understands the overall workflow.

In this tutorial, you'll build a personal assistant system that demonstrates these benefits through a realistic workflow. The system will coordinate two specialists with fundamentally different responsibilities:

- A **calendar agent** that handles scheduling, availability checking, and event management.
- An **email agent** that manages communication, drafts messages, and sends notifications.

We will also incorporate [human-in-the-loop review](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop) to allow users to approve, edit, and reject actions (such as outbound emails) as desired.

### Why use a supervisor?

Multi-agent architectures allow you to partition [tools](/oss/javascript/langchain/tools) across workers, each with their own individual prompts or instructions. Consider an agent with direct access to all calendar and email APIs: it must choose from many similar tools, understand exact formats for each API, and handle multiple domains simultaneously. If performance degrades, it may be helpful to separate related tools and associated prompts into logical groups (in part to manage iterative improvements).

### Concepts

We will cover the following concepts:

- [Multi-agent systems](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent)
- [Human-in-the-loop review](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop)

## Setup

### Installation

This tutorial requires the `langchain` package:



<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install langchain
```
```bash yarn
yarn add langchain
```
```bash pnpm
pnpm add langchain
```
</CodeGroup>


For more details, see our [Installation guide](/oss/javascript/langchain/install).

### LangSmith

Set up [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) to inspect what is happening inside your agent. Then set the following environment variables:



<CodeGroup>
```bash bash
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
```
```typescript typescript
process.env.LANGSMITH_TRACING = "true";
process.env.LANGSMITH_API_KEY = "...";
```
</CodeGroup>


### Components

We will need to select a chat model from LangChain's suite of integrations:



<ChatModelTabsJs />


## 1. Define tools

Start by defining the tools that require structured inputs. In real applications, these would call actual APIs (Google Calendar, SendGrid, etc.). For this tutorial, you'll use stubs to demonstrate the pattern.



```typescript
import { tool } from "langchain";
import { z } from "zod";

const createCalendarEvent = tool(
  async ({ title, startTime, endTime, attendees, location }) => {
    // Stub: In practice, this would call Google Calendar API, Outlook API, etc.
    return `Event created: ${title} from ${startTime} to ${endTime} with ${attendees.length} attendees`;
  },
  {
    name: "create_calendar_event",
    description: "Create a calendar event. Requires exact ISO datetime format.",
    schema: z.object({
      title: z.string(),
      startTime: z.string().describe("ISO format: '2024-01-15T14:00:00'"),
      endTime: z.string().describe("ISO format: '2024-01-15T15:00:00'"),
      attendees: z.array(z.string()).describe("email addresses"),
      location: z.string().optional(),
    }),
  }
);

const sendEmail = tool(
  async ({ to, subject, body, cc }) => {
    // Stub: In practice, this would call SendGrid, Gmail API, etc.
    return `Email sent to ${to.join(', ')} - Subject: ${subject}`;
  },
  {
    name: "send_email",
    description: "Send an email via email API. Requires properly formatted addresses.",
    schema: z.object({
      to: z.array(z.string()).describe("email addresses"),
      subject: z.string(),
      body: z.string(),
      cc: z.array(z.string()).optional(),
    }),
  }
);

const getAvailableTimeSlots = tool(
  async ({ attendees, date, durationMinutes }) => {
    // Stub: In practice, this would query calendar APIs
    return ["09:00", "14:00", "16:00"];
  },
  {
    name: "get_available_time_slots",
    description: "Check calendar availability for given attendees on a specific date.",
    schema: z.object({
      attendees: z.array(z.string()),
      date: z.string().describe("ISO format: '2024-01-15'"),
      durationMinutes: z.number(),
    }),
  }
);
```


## 2. Create specialized sub-agents

Next, we'll create specialized sub-agents that handle each domain.

### Create a calendar agent

The calendar agent understands natural language scheduling requests and translates them into precise API calls. It handles date parsing, availability checking, and event creation.



```typescript
import { createAgent } from "langchain";

const CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT = `
You are a calendar scheduling assistant.
Parse natural language scheduling requests (e.g., 'next Tuesday at 2pm')
into proper ISO datetime formats.
Use get_available_time_slots to check availability when needed.
Use create_calendar_event to schedule events.
Always confirm what was scheduled in your final response.
`.trim();

const calendarAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [createCalendarEvent, getAvailableTimeSlots],
  systemPrompt: CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT,
});
```


Test the calendar agent to see how it handles natural language scheduling:



```typescript
const query = "Schedule a team meeting next Tuesday at 2pm for 1 hour";

const stream = await calendarAgent.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }]
});

for await (const step of stream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  get_available_time_slots (call_EIeoeIi1hE2VmwZSfHStGmXp)
 Call ID: call_EIeoeIi1hE2VmwZSfHStGmXp
  Args:
    attendees: []
    date: 2024-06-18
    duration_minutes: 60
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: get_available_time_slots

["09:00", "14:00", "16:00"]
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  create_calendar_event (call_zgx3iJA66Ut0W8S3NpT93kEB)
 Call ID: call_zgx3iJA66Ut0W8S3NpT93kEB
  Args:
    title: Team Meeting
    start_time: 2024-06-18T14:00:00
    end_time: 2024-06-18T15:00:00
    attendees: []
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: create_calendar_event

Event created: Team Meeting from 2024-06-18T14:00:00 to 2024-06-18T15:00:00 with 0 attendees
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The team meeting has been scheduled for next Tuesday, June 18th, at 2:00 PM and will last for 1 hour. If you need to add attendees or a location, please let me know!
```

The agent parses "next Tuesday at 2pm" into ISO format ("2024-01-16T14:00:00"), calculates the end time, calls `create_calendar_event`, and returns a natural language confirmation.

### Create an email agent

The email agent handles message composition and sending. It focuses on extracting recipient information, crafting appropriate subject lines and body text, and managing email communication.



```typescript
const EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT = `
You are an email assistant.
Compose professional emails based on natural language requests.
Extract recipient information and craft appropriate subject lines and body text.
Use send_email to send the message.
Always confirm what was sent in your final response.
`.trim();

const emailAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [sendEmail],
  systemPrompt: EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT,
});
```

Test the email agent with a natural language request:

```typescript
const query = "Send the design team a reminder about reviewing the new mockups";

const stream = await emailAgent.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }]
});

for await (const step of stream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  send_email (call_OMl51FziTVY6CRZvzYfjYOZr)
 Call ID: call_OMl51FziTVY6CRZvzYfjYOZr
  Args:
    to: ['design-team@example.com']
    subject: Reminder: Please Review the New Mockups
    body: Hi Design Team,

This is a friendly reminder to review the new mockups at your earliest convenience. Your feedback is important to ensure that we stay on track with our project timeline.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

Thank you!

Best regards,
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: send_email

Email sent to design-team@example.com - Subject: Reminder: Please Review the New Mockups
================================== Ai Message ==================================

I've sent a reminder to the design team asking them to review the new mockups. If you need any further communication on this topic, just let me know!
```

The agent infers the recipient from the informal request, crafts a professional subject line and body, calls `send_email`, and returns a confirmation. Each sub-agent has a narrow focus with domain-specific tools and prompts, allowing it to excel at its specific task.

## 3. Wrap sub-agents as tools

Now wrap each sub-agent as a tool that the supervisor can invoke. This is the key architectural step that creates the layered system. The supervisor will see high-level tools like "schedule_event", not low-level tools like "create_calendar_event".



```typescript
const scheduleEvent = tool(
  async ({ request }) => {
    const result = await calendarAgent.invoke({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: request }]
    });
    const lastMessage = result.messages[result.messages.length - 1];
    return lastMessage.text;
  },
  {
    name: "schedule_event",
    description: `
Schedule calendar events using natural language.

Use this when the user wants to create, modify, or check calendar appointments.
Handles date/time parsing, availability checking, and event creation.

Input: Natural language scheduling request (e.g., 'meeting with design team next Tuesday at 2pm')
    `.trim(),
    schema: z.object({
      request: z.string().describe("Natural language scheduling request"),
    }),
  }
);

const manageEmail = tool(
  async ({ request }) => {
    const result = await emailAgent.invoke({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: request }]
    });
    const lastMessage = result.messages[result.messages.length - 1];
    return lastMessage.text;
  },
  {
    name: "manage_email",
    description: `
Send emails using natural language.

Use this when the user wants to send notifications, reminders, or any email communication.
Handles recipient extraction, subject generation, and email composition.

Input: Natural language email request (e.g., 'send them a reminder about the meeting')
    `.trim(),
    schema: z.object({
      request: z.string().describe("Natural language email request"),
    }),
  }
);
```


The tool descriptions help the supervisor decide when to use each tool, so make them clear and specific. We return only the sub-agent's final response, as the supervisor doesn't need to see intermediate reasoning or tool calls.

## 4. Create the supervisor agent

Now create the supervisor that orchestrates the sub-agents. The supervisor only sees high-level tools and makes routing decisions at the domain level, not the individual API level.



```typescript
const SUPERVISOR_PROMPT = `
You are a helpful personal assistant.
You can schedule calendar events and send emails.
Break down user requests into appropriate tool calls and coordinate the results.
When a request involves multiple actions, use multiple tools in sequence.
`.trim();

const supervisorAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [scheduleEvent, manageEmail],
  systemPrompt: SUPERVISOR_PROMPT,
});
```


## 5. Use the supervisor

Now test your complete system with complex requests that require coordination across multiple domains:

### Example 1: Simple single-domain request



```typescript
const query = "Schedule a team standup for tomorrow at 9am";

const stream = await supervisorAgent.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }]
});

for await (const step of stream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  schedule_event (call_mXFJJDU8bKZadNUZPaag8Lct)
 Call ID: call_mXFJJDU8bKZadNUZPaag8Lct
  Args:
    request: Schedule a team standup for tomorrow at 9am with Alice and Bob.
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: schedule_event

The team standup has been scheduled for tomorrow at 9:00 AM with Alice and Bob. If you need to make any changes or add more details, just let me know!
================================== Ai Message ==================================

The team standup with Alice and Bob is scheduled for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. If you need any further arrangements or adjustments, please let me know!
```

The supervisor identifies this as a calendar task, calls `schedule_event`, and the calendar agent handles date parsing and event creation.

</Tip>

### Example 2: Complex multi-domain request



```typescript
const query =
  "Schedule a meeting with the design team next Tuesday at 2pm for 1 hour, " +
  "and send them an email reminder about reviewing the new mockups.";

const stream = await supervisorAgent.stream({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }]
});

for await (const step of stream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```
================================== Ai Message ==================================
Tool Calls:
  schedule_event (call_YA68mqF0koZItCFPx0kGQfZi)
 Call ID: call_YA68mqF0koZItCFPx0kGQfZi
  Args:
    request: meeting with the design team next Tuesday at 2pm for 1 hour
  manage_email (call_XxqcJBvVIuKuRK794ZIzlLxx)
 Call ID: call_XxqcJBvVIuKuRK794ZIzlLxx
  Args:
    request: send the design team an email reminder about reviewing the new mockups
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: schedule_event

Your meeting with the design team is scheduled for next Tuesday, June 18th, from 2:00pm to 3:00pm. Let me know if you need to add more details or make any changes!
================================= Tool Message =================================
Name: manage_email

I've sent an email reminder to the design team requesting them to review the new mockups. If you need to include more information or recipients, just let me know!
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Your meeting with the design team is scheduled for next Tuesday, June 18th, from 2:00pm to 3:00pm.

I've also sent an email reminder to the design team, asking them to review the new mockups.

Let me know if you'd like to add more details to the meeting or include additional information in the email!
```

The supervisor recognizes this requires both calendar and email actions, calls `schedule_event` for the meeting, then calls `manage_email` for the reminder. Each sub-agent completes its task, and the supervisor synthesizes both results into a coherent response.

### Understanding the architecture

Your system has three layers. The bottom layer contains rigid API tools that require exact formats. The middle layer contains sub-agents that accept natural language, translate it to structured API calls, and return natural language confirmations. The top layer contains the supervisor that routes to high-level capabilities and synthesizes results.

This separation of concerns provides several benefits: each layer has a focused responsibility, you can add new domains without affecting existing ones, and you can test and iterate on each layer independently.

## 6. Add human-in-the-loop review

It can be prudent to incorporate [human-in-the-loop review](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop) of sensitive actions. LangChain includes [built-in middleware](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop#configuring-interrupts) to review tool calls, in this case the tools invoked by sub-agents.

Let's add human-in-the-loop review to both sub-agents:
- We configure the `create_calendar_event` and `send_email` tools to interrupt, permitting all [response types](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop) (`approve`, `edit`, `reject`)
- We add a [checkpointer](/oss/javascript/langchain/short-term-memory) **only to the top-level agent**. This is required to pause and resume execution.



```typescript
import { createAgent, humanInTheLoopMiddleware } from "langchain"; // [!code highlight]
import { MemorySaver } from "@langchain/langgraph"; // [!code highlight]

const calendarAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [createCalendarEvent, getAvailableTimeSlots],
  systemPrompt: CALENDAR_AGENT_PROMPT,
  middleware: [ // [!code highlight]
    humanInTheLoopMiddleware({ // [!code highlight]
      interruptOn: { create_calendar_event: true }, // [!code highlight]
      descriptionPrefix: "Calendar event pending approval", // [!code highlight]
    }), // [!code highlight]
  ], // [!code highlight]
});

const emailAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [sendEmail],
  systemPrompt: EMAIL_AGENT_PROMPT,
  middleware: [ // [!code highlight]
    humanInTheLoopMiddleware({ // [!code highlight]
      interruptOn: { send_email: true }, // [!code highlight]
      descriptionPrefix: "Outbound email pending approval", // [!code highlight]
    }), // [!code highlight]
  ], // [!code highlight]
});

const supervisorAgent = createAgent({
  model: llm,
  tools: [scheduleEvent, manageEmail],
  systemPrompt: SUPERVISOR_PROMPT,
  checkpointer: new MemorySaver(), // [!code highlight]
});
```


Let's repeat the query. Note that we gather interrupt events into a list to access downstream:



```typescript
const query =
  "Schedule a meeting with the design team next Tuesday at 2pm for 1 hour, " +
  "and send them an email reminder about reviewing the new mockups.";

const config = { configurable: { thread_id: "6" } };

const interrupts: any[] = [];
const stream = await supervisorAgent.stream(
  { messages: [{ role: "user", content: query }] },
  config
);

for await (const step of stream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    } else if (Array.isArray(update)) {
      const interrupt = update[0];
      interrupts.push(interrupt);
      console.log(`\nINTERRUPTED: ${interrupt.id}`);
    }
  }
}
```

This time we've interrupted execution. Let's inspect the interrupt events:



```typescript
for (const interrupt of interrupts) {
  for (const request of interrupt.value.actionRequests) {
    console.log(`INTERRUPTED: ${interrupt.id}`);
    console.log(`${request.description}\n`);
  }
}

Your feedback and insights will be valuable for our discussion and next steps.\n\nPlease ensure you've gone through the designs and are ready to share your thoughts during the meeting.\n\nThank you!\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]"}
```

We can specify decisions for each interrupt by referring to its ID using a [`Command`](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraphjs/reference/classes/langgraph.Command.html). Refer to the [human-in-the-loop guide](/oss/javascript/langchain/human-in-the-loop) for additional details. For demonstration purposes, here we will accept the calendar event, but edit the subject of the outbound email:



```typescript
import { Command } from "@langchain/langgraph"; // [!code highlight]

const resume: Record<string, any> = {};
for (const interrupt of interrupts) {
  const actionRequest = interrupt.value.actionRequests[0];
  if (actionRequest.name === "send_email") {
    // Edit email
    const editedAction = { ...actionRequest };
    editedAction.arguments.subject = "Mockups reminder";
    resume[interrupt.id] = {
      decisions: [{ type: "edit", editedAction }]
    };
  } else {
    resume[interrupt.id] = { decisions: [{ type: "approve" }] };
  }
}

const resumeStream = await supervisorAgent.stream(
  new Command({ resume }), // [!code highlight]
  config
);

for await (const step of resumeStream) {
  for (const update of Object.values(step)) {
    if (update && typeof update === "object" && "messages" in update) {
      for (const message of update.messages) {
        console.log(message.toFormattedString());
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 7. Advanced: Control information flow

By default, sub-agents receive only the request string from the supervisor. You might want to pass additional context, such as conversation history or user preferences.

### Pass additional conversational context to sub-agents



```typescript
import { getCurrentTaskInput } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import type { InternalAgentState } from "langchain";
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

const scheduleEvent = tool(
  async ({ request }, config) => {
    // Customize context received by sub-agent
    // Access full thread messages from the config
    const currentMessages = getCurrentTaskInput<InternalAgentState>(config).messages;

    const originalUserMessage = currentMessages.find(HumanMessage.isInstance);

    const prompt = `
You are assisting with the following user inquiry:

${originalUserMessage?.content || "No context available"}

You are tasked with the following sub-request:

${request}
    `.trim();

    const result = await calendarAgent.invoke({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    });
    const lastMessage = result.messages[result.messages.length - 1];
    return lastMessage.text;
  },
  {
    name: "schedule_event",
    description: "Schedule calendar events using natural language.",
    schema: z.object({
      request: z.string().describe("Natural language scheduling request"),
    }),
  }
);
```


This allows sub-agents to see the full conversation context, which can be useful for resolving ambiguities like "schedule it for the same time tomorrow" (referencing a previous conversation).

<Tip>
You can see the full context received by the sub agent in the [chat model call](https://smith.langchain.com/public/c7d54882-afb8-4039-9c5a-4112d0f458b0/r/6803571e-af78-4c68-904a-ecf55771084d) of the LangSmith trace.
</Tip>

### Control what supervisor receives

You can also customize what information flows back to the supervisor:



```typescript
const scheduleEvent = tool(
  async ({ request }) => {
    const result = await calendarAgent.invoke({
      messages: [{ role: "user", content: request }]
    });

    const lastMessage = result.messages[result.messages.length - 1];

    // Option 1: Return just the confirmation message
    return lastMessage.text;

    // Option 2: Return structured data
    // return JSON.stringify({
    //   status: "success",
    //   event_id: "evt_123",
    //   summary: lastMessage.text
    // });
  },
  {
    name: "schedule_event",
    description: "Schedule calendar events using natural language.",
    schema: z.object({
      request: z.string().describe("Natural language scheduling request"),
    }),
  }
);
```


**Important:** Make sure sub-agent prompts emphasize that their final message should contain all relevant information. A common failure mode is sub-agents that perform tool calls but don't include the results in their final response.

<Tip>
For a complete working example that demonstrates the full supervisor pattern with human-in-the-loop review and advanced information flow control, check out [`supervisor_complete.ts`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchainjs/blob/main/examples/src/createAgent/supervisor_complete.ts) in the LangChain.js examples.
</Tip>


## 8. Key takeaways

The supervisor pattern creates layers of abstraction where each layer has a clear responsibility. When designing a supervisor system, start with clear domain boundaries and give each sub-agent focused tools and prompts. Write clear tool descriptions for the supervisor, test each layer independently before integration, and control information flow based on your specific needs.

<Tip>
**When to use the supervisor pattern**

Use the supervisor pattern when you have multiple distinct domains (calendar, email, CRM, database), each domain has multiple tools or complex logic, you want centralized workflow control, and sub-agents don't need to converse directly with users.

For simpler cases with just a few tools, use a single agent. When agents need to have conversations with users, use [handoffs](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs) instead. For peer-to-peer collaboration between agents, consider other multi-agent patterns.
</Tip>

## Next steps

Learn about [handoffs](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent#handoffs) for agent-to-agent conversations, explore [context engineering](/oss/javascript/langchain/context-engineering) to fine-tune information flow, read the [multi-agent overview](/oss/javascript/langchain/multi-agent) to compare different patterns, and use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) to debug and monitor your multi-agent system.
