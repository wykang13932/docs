## Model

By default, `deepagents` uses `"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"`. You can customize this by passing any [LangChain model object](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/).



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


## System prompt

Deep agents come with a built-in system prompt inspired by Claude Code's system prompt. The default system prompt contains detailed instructions for using the built-in planning tool, file system tools, and subagents.

Each deep agent tailored to a use case should include a custom system prompt specific to that use case.



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


## Tools

Just like tool-calling agents, a deep agent gets a set of top level tools that it has access to.



```typescript
// TODO: Add JS implementation
```


In addition to any tools that you provide, deep agents also get access to a number of default tools:

- `write_todos` – Update the agent's to-do list
- `ls` – List all files in the agent's filesystem
- `read_file` – Read a file from the agent's filesystem
- `write_file` – Write a new file in the agent's filesystem
- `edit_file` – Edit an existing file in the agent's filesystem
- `task` – Spawn a subagent to handle a specific task
