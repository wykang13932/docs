## Overview

This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's [document loader](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#document-loaders), [embedding](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#embedding-models), and [vector store](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#vector-store) abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data--  from (vector) databases and other sources -- for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or [RAG](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval).

Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query. The guide also includes a minimal RAG implementation on top of the search engine.

### Concepts

This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:

- [Documents and document loaders](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders);
- [Text splitters](/oss/python/integrations/splitters);
- [Embeddings](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding);
- [Vector stores](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores) and [retrievers](/oss/python/integrations/retrievers).

## Setup

### Installation

This tutorial requires the `langchain-community` and `pypdf` packages:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install langchain-community pypdf
```
```bash conda
conda install langchain-community pypdf -c conda-forge
```
</CodeGroup>





For more details, see our [Installation guide](/oss/python/langchain/install).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGSMITH_TRACING="true"
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY="..."
```

Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```



## 1. Documents and Document Loaders

LangChain implements a [Document](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has three attributes:

- `page_content`: a string representing the content;
- `metadata`: a dict containing arbitrary metadata;
- `id`: (optional) a string identifier for the document.



The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual [`Document`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) object often represents a chunk of a larger document.

We can generate sample documents when desired:

```python
from langchain_core.documents import Document

documents = [
    Document(
        page_content="Dogs are great companions, known for their loyalty and friendliness.",
        metadata={"source": "mammal-pets-doc"},
    ),
    Document(
        page_content="Cats are independent pets that often enjoy their own space.",
        metadata={"source": "mammal-pets-doc"},
    ),
]
```



However, the LangChain ecosystem implements [document loaders](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#document-loaders) that [integrate with hundreds of common sources](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/). This makes it easy to incorporate data from these sources into your AI application.

### Loading documents

Let's load a PDF into a sequence of [`Document`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects. [Here is a sample PDF](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain/blob/v0.3/docs/docs/example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf) -- a 10-k filing for Nike from 2023. We can consult the LangChain documentation for [available PDF document loaders](/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders/#pdfs).

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader

file_path = "../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf"
loader = PyPDFLoader(file_path)

docs = loader.load()

print(len(docs))
```
```output
107
```

`PyPDFLoader` loads one [`Document`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) object per PDF page. For each, we can easily access:

- The string content of the page;
- Metadata containing the file name and page number.



```python
print(f"{docs[0].page_content[:200]}\n")
print(docs[0].metadata)
```
```output
Table of Contents
UNITED STATES
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C. 20549
FORM 10-K
(Mark One)
☑ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(D) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
FO

{'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'page': 0}
```



### Splitting

For both information retrieval and downstream question-answering purposes, a page may be too coarse a representation. Our goal in the end will be to retrieve [`Document`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects that answer an input query, and further splitting our PDF will help ensure that the meanings of relevant portions of the document are not "washed out" by surrounding text.

We can use [text splitters](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#text_splitters) for this purpose. Here we will use a simple text splitter that partitions based on characters. We will split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters
with 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps
mitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important
context related to it. We use the
`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`,
which will recursively split the document using common separators like
new lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the
recommended text splitter for generic text use cases.

We set `add_start_index=True` so that the character index where each
split Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as
metadata attribute “start_index”.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True
)
all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)

print(len(all_splits))
```



```output
514
```


## 2. Embeddings

Vector search is a common way to store and search over unstructured data (such as unstructured text). The idea is to store numeric vectors that are associated with the text. Given a query, we can [embed](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#embedding_models) it as a vector of the same dimension and use vector similarity metrics (such as cosine similarity) to identify related text.

LangChain supports embeddings from [dozens of providers](/oss/python/integrations/text_embedding/). These models specify how text should be converted into a numeric vector. Let's select a model:

<EmbeddingsTabsPy />

```python
vector_1 = embeddings.embed_query(all_splits[0].page_content)
vector_2 = embeddings.embed_query(all_splits[1].page_content)

assert len(vector_1) == len(vector_2)
print(f"Generated vectors of length {len(vector_1)}\n")
print(vector_1[:10])
```



```output
Generated vectors of length 1536

[-0.008586574345827103, -0.03341241180896759, -0.008936782367527485, -0.0036674530711025, 0.010564599186182022, 0.009598285891115665, -0.028587326407432556, -0.015824200585484505, 0.0030416189692914486, -0.012899317778646946]
```
Armed with a model for generating text embeddings, we can next store them in a special data structure that supports efficient similarity search.

## 3. Vector stores

LangChain [VectorStore](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/vectorstores/?h=#langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStore) objects contain methods for adding text and [`Document`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects to the store, and querying them using various similarity metrics. They are often initialized with [embedding](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval#embedding_models) models, which determine how text data is translated to numeric vectors.

LangChain includes a suite of [integrations](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores) with different vector store technologies. Some vector stores are hosted by a provider (e.g., various cloud providers) and require specific credentials to use; some (such as [Postgres](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores/pgvector)) run in separate infrastructure that can be run locally or via a third-party; others can run in-memory for lightweight workloads. Let's select a vector store:

<VectorstoreTabsPy />



Having instantiated our vector store, we can now index the documents.

```python
ids = vector_store.add_documents(documents=all_splits)
```



Note that most vector store implementations will allow you to connect to an existing vector store--  e.g., by providing a client, index name, or other information. See the documentation for a specific [integration](/oss/python/integrations/vectorstores) for more detail.

Once we've instantiated a [`VectorStore`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/vectorstores/?h=#langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStore) that contains documents, we can query it. [VectorStore](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/vectorstores/?h=#langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStore) includes methods for querying:
- Synchronously and asynchronously;
- By string query and by vector;
- With and without returning similarity scores;
- By similarity and @[maximum marginal relevance][VectorStore.max_marginal_relevance_search] (to balance similarity with query to diversity in retrieved results).

The methods will generally include a list of [Document](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/documents/#langchain_core.documents.base.Document) objects in their outputs.

**Usage**

Embeddings typically represent text as a "dense" vector such that texts with similar meanings are geometrically close. This lets us retrieve relevant information just by passing in a question, without knowledge of any specific key-terms used in the document.

Return documents based on similarity to a string query:

```python
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "How many distribution centers does Nike have in the US?"
)

print(results[0])
```
```output
page_content='direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:
U.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER
NIKE Brand factory stores 213
NIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 74
Converse stores (including factory stores) 82
TOTAL 369
In the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Refer to Item 2. Properties for further information.
2023 FORM 10-K 2' metadata={'page': 4, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 3125}
```



Async query:

```python
results = await vector_store.asimilarity_search("When was Nike incorporated?")

print(results[0])
```
```output
page_content='Table of Contents

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is
the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores
and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales' metadata={'page': 3, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 0}
```


Return scores:

```python
# Note that providers implement different scores; the score here
# is a distance metric that varies inversely with similarity.

results = vector_store.similarity_search_with_score("What was Nike's revenue in 2023?")
doc, score = results[0]
print(f"Score: {score}\n")
print(doc)
```

43.5% for fiscal 2023 compared to 46.0% for fiscal 2022 due to the following:
*Wholesale equivalent
The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2023 was primarily due to:
•Higher NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis, primarily due to higher input costs and elevated inbound freight and logistics costs as well as
product mix;
•Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business, driven by higher promotional activity to liquidate inventory in the current period compared to lower promotional activity in
the prior period resulting from lower available inventory supply;
•Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges; and
•Lower off-price margin, on a wholesale equivalent basis.

## 4. Retrievers

LangChain [`VectorStore`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/vectorstores/?h=#langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStore) objects do not subclass @[Runnable]. LangChain @[Retrievers] are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous `invoke` and `batch` operations). Although we can construct retrievers from vector stores, retrievers can interface with non-vector store sources of data, as well (such as external APIs).

We can create a simple version of this ourselves, without subclassing `Retriever`. If we choose what method we wish to use to retrieve documents, we can create a runnable easily. Below we will build one around the `similarity_search` method:


```python
from typing import List

from langchain_core.documents import Document
from langchain_core.runnables import chain


@chain
def retriever(query: str) -> List[Document]:
    return vector_store.similarity_search(query, k=1)


retriever.batch(
    [
        "How many distribution centers does Nike have in the US?",
        "When was Nike incorporated?",
    ],
)
```



```output
[[Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 3125}, page_content='direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:\nU.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER\nNIKE Brand factory stores 213 \nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 74 \nConverse stores (including factory stores) 82 \nTOTAL 369 \nIn the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Refer to Item 2. Properties for further information.\n2023 FORM 10-K 2')],
 [Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 0}, page_content='Table of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), the terms "we," "us," "our,"\n"NIKE" and the "Company" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is\nthe largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\nand sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales')]]
```


Vectorstores implement an `as_retriever` method that will generate a Retriever, specifically a [VectorStoreRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/vectorstores/langchain_core.vectorstores.base.VectorStoreRetriever.html). These retrievers include specific `search_type` and `search_kwargs` attributes that identify what methods of the underlying vector store to call, and how to parameterize them. For instance, we can replicate the above with the following:

```python
retriever = vector_store.as_retriever(
    search_type="similarity",
    search_kwargs={"k": 1},
)

retriever.batch(
    [
        "How many distribution centers does Nike have in the US?",
        "When was Nike incorporated?",
    ],
)
```
```output
[[Document(metadata={'page': 4, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 3125}, page_content='direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:\nU.S. RETAIL STORES NUMBER\nNIKE Brand factory stores 213 \nNIKE Brand in-line stores (including employee-only stores) 74 \nConverse stores (including factory stores) 82 \nTOTAL 369 \nIn the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Refer to Item 2. Properties for further information.\n2023 FORM 10-K 2')],
 [Document(metadata={'page': 3, 'source': '../example_data/nke-10k-2023.pdf', 'start_index': 0}, page_content='Table of Contents\nPART I\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGENERAL\nNIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), the terms "we," "us," "our,"\n"NIKE" and the "Company" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.\nOur principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services.

We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores\nand sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital"), to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales')]]
```

`VectorStoreRetriever` supports search types of `"similarity"` (default), `"mmr"` (maximum marginal relevance, described above), and `"similarity_score_threshold"`. We can use the latter to threshold documents output by the retriever by similarity score.



Retrievers can easily be incorporated into more complex applications, such as [retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval) applications that combine a given question with retrieved context into a prompt for a LLM. To learn more about building such an application, check out the [RAG tutorial](/oss/python/langchain/rag) tutorial.
