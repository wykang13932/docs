Traces are a series of steps that your application takes to go from input to output. Each of these individual steps is represented by a run. You can use [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) to visualize these execution steps. To use it, [enable tracing for your application](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph). This enables you to do the following:

* [Debug a locally running application](/langsmith/observability-studio#debug-langsmith-traces).
* [Evaluate the application performance](/oss/python/langchain/evals).
* [Monitor the application](/langsmith/dashboards).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

* A [LangSmith account](https://smith.langchain.com/) (free to sign up)

## Enable tracing

To enable tracing for your application, set the following environment variables:

```python
export LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

By default, the trace will be logged to the project with the name `default`. To configure a custom project name, see [Log to a project](#log-to-a-project).

For more information, see [Trace with LangGraph](/langsmith/trace-with-langgraph).

## Use anonymizers to prevent logging of sensitive data in traces

You may want to mask sensitive data to prevent it from being logged to LangSmith. You can create [anonymizers](/langsmith/mask-inputs-outputs#rule-based-masking-of-inputs-and-outputs) and apply them to
your graph using configuration. This example will redact anything matching the Social Security Number format XXX-XX-XXXX from traces sent to LangSmith.

```python Python
from langchain_core.tracers.langchain import LangChainTracer
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, MessagesState
from langsmith import Client
from langsmith.anonymizer import create_anonymizer

anonymizer = create_anonymizer([
    # Matches SSNs
    { "pattern": r"\b\d{3}-?\d{2}-?\d{4}\b", "replace": "<ssn>" }
])

tracer_client = Client(anonymizer=anonymizer)
tracer = LangChainTracer(client=tracer_client)
# Define the graph
graph = (
    StateGraph(MessagesState)
    ...
    .compile()
    .with_config({'callbacks': [tracer]})
)
```
