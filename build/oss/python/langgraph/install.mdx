To install the base LangGraph package:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U langgraph
```

```bash uv
uv add langgraph
```
</CodeGroup>




To use LangGraph you will usually want to access LLMs and define tools.
You can do this however you see fit.

One way to do this (which we will use in the docs) is to use [LangChain](/oss/python/langchain/overview).

Install LangChain with:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U langchain
```

```bash uv
uv add langchain
```
</CodeGroup>




To work with specific LLM provider packages, you will need install them separately.

Refer to the [integrations](/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) page for provider-specific installation instructions.
