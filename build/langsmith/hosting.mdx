This section covers how to host and manage LangSmith infrastructure. You can set up LangSmith for [observability](/langsmith/observability), [evaluation](/langsmith/evaluation), and [prompt engineering](/langsmith/prompt-engineering), or use the full platform experience with [LangSmith Deployment](/langsmith/deployments) to also deploy and manage your applications through the UI.

**Start here if you're setting up or maintaining LangSmith infrastructure.**

If you want to deploy an agent application, the [Deployment section](/langsmith/deployments) covers application structure and deployment configuration.
</Callout>

## Choose your hosting option

You'll deploy LangSmith in one of three modes:
- [**Cloud**](/langsmith/cloud): fully managed by LangChain
- [**Hybrid**](/langsmith/hybrid): LangChain manages the <Tooltip tip="The LangSmith UI and APIs for managing deployments.">control plane</Tooltip>; you host the <Tooltip tip="The runtime environment where your LangGraph Servers and agents execute.">data plane</Tooltip>
- [**Self-hosted**](/langsmith/self-hosted): you manage the full stack within your infrastructure
